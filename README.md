## General Information
- Neon Dungeon Turbo Drake Adventure (NDTDA) is a Rogue Like inspired by no other game than Rogue itself, Synthwave and Vampires.
- You play as the Turbo Drake - manifestation of Vlad Drakula Tepesh in the Synthwave inspired world where Neons are the source of power.
- The lower you go through the dungeon the more dangerous it gets, be ready to get more powerful as well by feeding upon the enemies residing this wretched place.
- The game is in very early stages of development, but content is planned to be added as frequent as possible, as this is my side project and I have no time or resources to commit to this 100% unfortunately.


## Technologies Used
- cffi==1.15.0
- numpy==1.22.3
- pycparser==2.21
- tcod==13.6.2
- typing_extensions==4.2.0


## Content
Content already in the game:

Enemies:
- Commoner [c] - Low class human, for some reason there are many of them in the dungeon. They posses no real threat, easy prey for Drake.
- Templar [T] - Templars are assigned by the Neon Church to protect the Commoners inside the dungeon, the lower you go the more you will encounter them, looks like they do not bother about the entrance anymore. Fairly powerful beings.

Items:
- Neon Blood Vial [!] - Blood Vial contaminated by the large amount of Neon - for mere human it is like a drug, easy to get addicted to it and loose sanity trying to find more and more. For Drake, it is great source of Health, fantastic to regain Vitals before next fights.
- Neon Bolt Chip [~] - This Chip contains technology to cast Neon Bolt, harming enemies by dealing them massive damage.
- Confusion Chip [~] -  This Chip contains technology to cast Confusion "spell", making enemies lose their mind for a brief moment.
- Neonball Chip [~] - This Chip contains technilogy on how to cast Neonball, powerfull AoE spell, dealing damage on fairly wide range.

Equipment:
- Neon Dagger [/] - Simple dagger infused with Neon, probably due to long exposure within the dungeon. Great for dealing with small threats
- Neon Saber [/] - Saber greatly infused with Neon, can be found in lower levels of the dungeon, probably was used by previous residents of this place, an elegant weapon for a more civilized age.
- Light Armor [ [ ] - Light armor, providing small amount of defense, but even that is better than nothing and can save your life.
- Medium Armor [ [ ] - Medium armor, providing moderate amount of defense, great for more powerful enemies.
